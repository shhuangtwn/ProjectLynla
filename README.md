# Project Lynla

#About
Lynla is a beer scanning app which allows you to record the great beers you have tasted by scanning a barcode and taking a picture of the beer product. Instead of specifying the beer's type or ingredients with professional terms - simply rate and choose the feeling you have of its flavor and taste intuitively. And we will do the rest of the analyzing work for you, Lynla!

#Function
* Beer barcode and image scanning
* Personal taste recording and analyzing
